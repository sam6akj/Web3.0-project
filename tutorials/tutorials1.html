            <h2>What is crypto and Ethereum?</h2>
            <p>You have probably heard a thing or two about cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, and blockchain, but do you know what those actually are and how they relate to Ethereum?<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/" style="color:#0078AA ;"> And what is Ethereum anyway?</a><br><br>
            Not only can Ethereum do what Bitcoin does (transfer money globally), it’s capable of much more – anyone can deploy code onto the network. And because it’s so flexible, any computer program can run on Ethereum.</p>
       <h2>What is a cryptocurrency?</h2>
       <p><strong> Crypto (short for cryptocurrency) is a new form of digital money powered by cryptography.</strong><br
        It all started in 2008 with Bitcoin. You could use it to send funds to anyone anywhere globally. What made crypto different from normal bank transfers or other financial services like Paypal or Alipay is that there was no middle man for the first time.<br>
        <br>
        Wait, what is a middle man?<br>
        <br>
        A middle-man is a central authority like a bank or government that intervenes in a transaction between the sender and recipient. They have the power to surveill, censor or revert transactions and they can share the sensitive data they collect about you with third parties. They also often dictate which financial services you have access to.<br>
        <br>
        Things are different with crypto. <strong> directly connect sender and recipient</strong> without having to deal with any central authority. Nobody else will have access to your funds and <strong>can tell you what services you can use.</strong> This is possible because of the blockchain technology upon which cryptocurrencies operate.

        <h2>What is Ethereum?</h2>
        <p>At its core, Ethereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by <u>blockchain technology</u>. It is most commonly known for its native cryptocurrency, ether, or ETH.</p>
        <p>Ethereum can be used by anyone to create any secured digital technology. It has a token designed for use in the blockchain network, but it can also be used by participants as a method to pay for work done on the blockchain.</p>
        <p>Ethereum is designed to be scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It is the blockchain of choice for developers and enterprises that are creating technology based upon it to change the way many industries operate and how we go about our daily lives.</p>
        <p>It natively supports <u>smart contracts</u>, the essential tool behind <u>decentralized applications.</u>Many <u>decentralized finance</u> (DeFi) and other applications use smart contracts in conjunction with blockchain technology.</p>
