           <h2>Learn about the Ethereum community</h2> 
<P>The success of Ethereum is thanks to its incredibly dedicated community. Thousands of inspiring and driven people help push Ethereumâ€™s vision forward. Come and join us!</P>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>There are many ways to get involved in the fast-growing Ethereum community; you can join one of the popular online communities, attend an event, join a meetup group, contribute to a project, or participate in one of the many online forums about Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Ethereum support</h2>
<p>Need support? There is no official Ethereum support, but hundreds of helpful communities are available to help you prosper on Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Official Ethereum support</h2>
<p>Are you looking for the official Ethereum support? The first thing you should know is that Ethereum is decentralized. This means no central organization, entity, or person owns Ethereum, and because of this, no official support channels exist.</p>
<p>Understanding the decentralized nature of Ethereum is vital because anyone claiming to be official support for Ethereum is probably trying to scam you! The best protection against scammers is educating yourself and taking security seriously.</p>
