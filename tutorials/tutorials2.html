            <h2>How do I use Ethereum?</h2>
                <p>  Using Ethereum is relatively straightforward once you get the hang of it. First, you need to download a "wallet". A wallet is an app that helps you store your crypto and interact with applications on Ethereum.</p>
               <h2> What's an Ethereum wallet?</h2>
<p>Ethereum wallets are applications that let you interact with your Ethereum account. Think of it like an internet banking app – without the bank. Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions and connect to applications.<br>
    <br>
You need a wallet to send funds and manage your ETH. More on ETH<br>
<br>
Your wallet is only a tool for managing your Ethereum account. That means you can swap wallet providers at any time. Many wallets also let you manage several Ethereum accounts from one application.<br>
<br>
That's because wallets don't have custody of your funds, you do. They're just a tool for managing what's really yours.</p>
<h2>An app for managing your funds</h2>
<p>Your wallet shows your balances, transaction history and gives you a way to send/receive funds. Some wallets may offer more.</p>
<h2>Your Ethereum account</h2>
<p>Your wallet is your window into your Ethereum account – your balance, transaction history and more. But you can swap wallet providers at any time.</p>
<h2>Your login for Ethereum apps</h2>
<p>Your wallet lets you connect to any decentralized application using your Ethereum account. It's like a login you can use across many dapps.</p>
<h2>Wallets, accounts, and addresses</h2>
<p>It's worth understanding the differences between some key terms.<br>
    <br>

An Ethereum account is an entity that can send transactions and has a balance.<br>
<br>

An Ethereum account has an Ethereum address, like an inbox has an email address. You can use this to send funds to an account.<br>
<br>

A wallet is a product that lets you manage your Ethereum account. It allows you to view your account balance, send transactions, and more.<br>
<br>

Most wallet products will let you generate an Ethereum account. So you don't need one before you download a wallet.</p><br>
